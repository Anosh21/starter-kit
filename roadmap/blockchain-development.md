## Blockchain App Development
Blockchain is a new application model of computer technology distributed with data storage, peer-to-peer transactions, consensus mechanisms, and encryption algorithm. Blockchain is based on three feature i.e consensus, node and multiple center and it's characteristics are immutability, traceabilility, privacy protection and independence.

Blockchain app developers write smart contracts which are reusable snippet of code that a developer publishes into the BVM(Blockchain Virtual Machine like EVM) memory. Smart Contracts are written with programming langauges like Solidity, Clarity and Rust. Solidity is commonly used in most blockchain networks e.g Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain among others, Clarity is used on Stacks and Rust is used on Solana. Blockchain app developers build applications called dApps(decentralized applications) that use smart contracts as their backend. Frontend of dApps can be built using HTML, CSS and Javascript library like Web3js to interact with smart contract or build wallet integrations. Nonetheless Front-end Frameworks like React can be use to speed up building the Front-end.

DeFi(Decentralized Finance) is one of the main smart contract use cases. As a blockchain developer learn DeFi fundamental concepts, main DeFi protocols & DeFi Exchanges, use APIs of main DeFi projects, and finally build your own DeFi projects.
